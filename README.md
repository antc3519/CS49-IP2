# CS490-IP2
Second individual project for CS 490 - Guided Design in Software Engineering

The objective for this semesterâ€™s individual project is to implement this new GameArea abstraction, with one concrete implementation: TicTacToeArea. The TicTacToeArea will implement the gameplay for the classic game, Tic-Tac-Toe. This implementation effort will be split across two deliverables. In this second deliverable, you will implement and (partially) test the core frontend components.
